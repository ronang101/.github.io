# Flagogories

## Introduction
This website was created as a fun project to learn about web development, I had never used javascript before so I took this as a learning experience. The idea for this started since I wanted to get back into coding but wasn't sure what to create, however, I saw people playing a game on social media where they would have a random countries flag appear and would have to select a sport for that country from a list of 10 sports. In this game when you select a sport for a country this contributes to your score by adding that countries world ranking in the sport to your score, for example Argentina rank 1 for football since they won the last world cup giving you a score of 1, then if you were to select Serbia for tennis you would get another score of 1 giving you a total score of 2. The objective of the game is to select a sport for all 10 countries and score below 200. I thought this game was quite interesting so I decided I would make a website for the game, and I took inspiration from wordle by adding a daily game where all users are given the same 10 countries each day with a gurantee you can score below 200 with these countries.

## How to play

In order to play the game it is very simple, we have a daily game and a replayable game which you can visit at this link:

## Additonal code

I also host two sscripts on replit, one script is written in python, the other in node.js. You can view the code here:

## What I learnt

Through creating this website I learnt a lot about web development concepts and also how to organize and write professional looking code. I learnt about organization and writing neat code through the failures I experienced in creating this website. I did not organize the code well at all here, there is no modularization, poor comments and a lack of reusability. Overitme I realized how hard this made the code to maintain and for other developers to come on board. This is something I have worked very hard on in my recent renting website project, I made sure the files were structured well and the python code followed PEP 8 guidelines and my javascript followed javascript standard style guidelines.
